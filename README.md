This script is designed to synchronize two folders by copying any new or modified files from the source folder to the replica folder at specified intervals. It also creates any directories that exist in the source folder but not in the replica folder.

To run the script, use the following command:

python sync_folders.py source_folder replica_folder log_file_path [-i interval]

where:

source_folder is the path to the source folder
replica_folder is the path to the replica folder
log_file_path is the path to the log file
[-i interval] (optional) is the interval between syncs in seconds (default is 10 seconds)
The script will create the replica folder if it does not already exist. It will then start syncing the folders at the specified interval, continuously checking for any new or modified files in the source folder.

The log file will contain a record of all the actions performed by the script, including the creation of directories and the copying of files.

Note: This script requires the "os", "shutil", "time", and "argparse" modules to be imported.
